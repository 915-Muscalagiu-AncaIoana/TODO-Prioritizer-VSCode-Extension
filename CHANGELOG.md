# Changelog

All notable changes to the "TODO Code Tracker" extension will be documented in this file.

## Released

## 1.0.0 - 2023-04-28
### Added
- **Autocomplete TODO Comments Feature**: Introduces autocompletion for `TODO-HIGH`, `TODO-MEDIUM`, `TODO-LOW` when you start typing `TODO` in your JavaScript or TypeScript files. This helps in setting the priority of your tasks directly from your code editor.
  
- **Find TODOs Command**: Added a new command that scans your project for all TODO comments and displays them organized by priority in a list. This list is accessible through the Command Palette or the `Ctrl+Alt+T` shortcut on Windows/Linux and `Cmd+Alt+T` on macOS. Clicking on a TODO item in the list will navigate directly to the file and line of the comment.

### Fixed
- No specific fixes in this release as it is the initial launch.

### Known Issues
- The TODO list may not refresh automatically when new TODO comments are added or existing ones are modified. Users may need to manually refresh the list to see updates.

We hope you find the "TODO Code Tracker" extension useful in managing your coding tasks more efficiently!
